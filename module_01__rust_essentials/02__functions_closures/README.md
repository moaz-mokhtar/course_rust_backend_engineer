# Functions and Closures in Rust

## Functions and Closures
- Functions: are blocks of code that perform a specific task. They can take parameters and return a value.
- Closures: Unlike functions, closures are anonymous functions that can capture values from the scope in which they are defined. This feature allows for code reuse and behavior customization. Closures can be stored in variables or passed as arguments to other functions.
