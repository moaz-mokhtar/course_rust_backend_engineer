# Data Types with Rust

## Data Types
Rust offers a variety of data types to work with:
- Scalar Types: These include integers, floating-point numbers, Booleans, and characters. Each of these types represents a single value.
- Compound Types: Rust also provides compound types like tuples and arrays, which can hold multiple values.

## Variables
In Rust, variables are fundamental. They come in three forms:
- Immutable: By default, variables are immutable. This means once a value is bound to a name, you cannot change that value.
- Mutable: You can make a variable mutable by using the mut keyword. This allows the variable to be changed after its initial assignment.
- Const: Constants are similar to variables, but their value is set at compile time and cannot be changed.
